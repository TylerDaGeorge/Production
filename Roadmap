Hybrid Smart Production Planning + Gamified Job Board Roadmap

Phase 1: Core Scheduling + Basic Job Board
Goal: Build a solid scheduling backbone and simple job board where operators can see and pick jobs.
Features:
APS Engine generates optimized schedules based on setup times, due dates, machine availability
Job Board UI lists all current jobs with due dates, priorities, and statuses
Operators can claim/unclaim jobs from the board
Job details and instructions visible on job cards
Manager dashboard to monitor assignments and schedule adherence
Tech Notes:
Backend REST API for scheduling, job status, assignments
Frontend React/Vue with drag-and-drop or click-to-claim UI
Basic user authentication & roles (operators, managers)

Phase 2: Gamification Layer & Priority Highlights
Goal: Add engagement and motivation with gamification and dynamic job priority indicators.
Features:
“Hot Job” tagging: jobs nearing due date or critical flagged prominently on job board
Points system: operators earn points for completing jobs, bonuses for hot jobs or on-time delivery
Leaderboards: daily/weekly rankings displayed publicly
Badges/achievements for milestones (e.g., “5 hot jobs completed”)
Notifications/reminders for hot jobs or when jobs are unclaimed too long
Tech Notes:
Points and badges tracked in user profiles in backend
Real-time UI updates (WebSockets or polling) for hot jobs and leaderboard
Notification system (in-app and optionally push/email)

Phase 3: Advanced Scheduling Adjustments & Manager Controls
Goal: Improve scheduling flexibility with AI and allow managers to nudge assignments.
Features:
LLM-powered assistant to accept natural language commands (“Prioritize rush order #123”)
Auto-suggestions for unclaimed or delayed jobs to specific operators based on skills/availability
Manager override to reassign or lock jobs when necessary
Analytics on job board usage, claim patterns, and bottlenecks
Tech Notes:
Integration with OpenAI or other LLM APIs
Rules engine to match jobs with operator skill sets and workload
Enhanced role permissions for overrides and nudges

Phase 4: Workforce Performance & Feedback Loop
Goal: Track operator performance and use data to refine scheduling and gamification.
Features:
Time and performance tracking: jobs completed, scrap rates, rework logged per operator
Coaching suggestions based on performance trends
Feedback system for operators to rate jobs and report issues
Adjust point rewards and scheduling priorities based on operator feedback and data
Tech Notes:
Analytics dashboards for managers
Backend ML models or heuristics for coaching & adjustment logic
Feedback form integration

Phase 5: Inventory Integration & Predictive Forecasting
Goal: Connect inventory status to job availability and forecast future workload/resource needs.
Features:
Real-time inventory sync: jobs become claimable only if required materials/tools are available
Automated reorder triggers based on upcoming jobs and lead times
Forecasting engine for expected workloads and resource planning
Alerts for material shortages affecting job scheduling
Tech Notes:
Integration with inventory management systems or IoT sensors
Forecasting libraries/models (Prophet, ARIMA)
Scheduler updates to block/unblock jobs dynamically based on inventory

Phase 6: Mobile App & Enhanced User Experience
Goal: Provide on-the-go access and improve usability for operators and managers.
Features:
Mobile-friendly job board with claim/complete functionality
Real-time notifications for hot jobs, point updates, and alerts
Offline mode with sync for limited connectivity environments
Visual digital work instructions integrated with job cards
Tech Notes:
Cross-platform mobile app (React Native, Flutter) or responsive web design
Push notification services (Firebase Cloud Messaging, OneSignal)

Cross-Phase Considerations
Security & Roles: Robust authentication and role-based access control throughout
Scalability: Modular backend microservices or scalable monolith depending on size
DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, cloud deployment
Data Privacy & Compliance: Ensure data handling meets relevant regulations
Pre-Development Planning Checklist
Step 1: User and Stakeholder Discovery – Complete
Users: Operators and Managers.
User Research Done: Not yet conducted.
Current Pain Points:
Lack of clarity on how many parts to produce.
Difficulty locating critical job paperwork (prints, inspection docs).
Uncertainty about material availability or location.
Motivations:
Gamification is likely to improve engagement slightly and reduce overhead micromanagement.
Operators are familiar with gaming, so points and streak systems will resonate.
Key motivators: recognition and smoother workflows.
Step 2: Data Architecture & Flow Design – Complete
2.1 Data to Store
Job Information:
Part name, operation number, build quantity, due date, ETA
Operator Data:
Name, login credentials, points, personal performance records (e.g., max parts made per day)
Job Statuses:
Not started, needs material ordered, waiting for material, waiting to be set up, getting set up, running, finished, at external vendor
Inventory Data:
Part-level inventory count to determine production needs based on forecast
Forecasting Data (read-only or reference)
Due quantities and due dates from customers
Historical Performance:
Operator-level metrics (optional but desirable)
2.2 Key Data Relationships
Each part has a list of operations (e.g., op10, op20).
Each operation belongs to exactly one part.
Each operation is claimed by one operator at a time.
Each operator may work on multiple part-operation combos — just not simultaneously on the same one as another operator.
When all operations of a part are complete, the part is marked complete and added to stock.
2.3 Data Update Behavior
Real-time updates required:
Any change to job status, assignments, completions, etc., should instantly reflect across the app.
Step 3: System Integrations – Complete
3.1 Current Tracking Methods
Inventory:
Physically stored in shipping; manually monitored.
Restocking is inconsistent and relies on shipping staff noticing low levels.
Missed signals lead to delays in ordering and fulfillment.
Forecasted Demand:
Provided by customers via Excel spreadsheets.
These are non-binding but used internally for planning.
Actual Orders:
Customers send actual order numbers when parts are needed.
Job Information:
Partially stored in ERP (JobBOSS), but entries are incomplete/unreliable.
Setup information lives in Word documents created by production staff.
Performance Metrics:
KPIs like cycle times, scrap rates, and daily output are not consistently tracked.
Some efforts have begun to capture this in Excel manually.
3.2 Existing Tools and Systems
ERP: JobBOSS (underutilized; data unreliable)
Forecasts: Excel files from customers
Setup Sheets: Word documents
Emerging KPI Tracking: Excel spreadsheet (in progress)
3.3 Integration Strategy
Data Integration via Periodic Imports:
No direct API integrations planned for now.
Excel file imports (e.g., forecasts) will be used to populate and update the app’s schedule and job planning logic.
Step 4: Authorization & Access Control – Complete
4.1 Defined Roles
Operator
Department Lead
Shipping
Admin
4.2 Permissions Breakdown
Operators:
See and claim jobs
View own and others’ points and stats
Update job status (e.g., “running,” “finished”)
Department Leads:
See all jobs and user stats
Assign/reassign jobs to operators
View job board analytics
Shipping:
Update job statuses related to material (e.g., "waiting for material", "material received")
Promote jobs to “hot” or “emergency” status for urgent attention
Admins:
Full access, including user/role management, analytics, system configuration, and overrides
4.3 Stat Visibility
Full transparency: All users can see everyone else’s points, badges, and job history.
Step 5: Scalability & Hosting Decisions – Complete
5.1 Hosting Model
Hybrid-first: Primarily local usage with cloud syncing capabilities.
Enables internal functionality even if internet access is temporarily unavailable.
Syncs data to the cloud for multi-device access, mobile use, backups, and optional remote management.
5.2 Expected Users
10–20 concurrent users, mostly operators and department leads.
5.3 Scaling Plan
Start with a functional, lightweight MVP with:
Local-first logic and storage.
Modular backend that allows scaling up (e.g., migrating to cloud microservices later).
App must be usable from day one, not stripped down.
Step 6: MVP Scope Definition – Complete
6.1 Minimum Launch Features
Job Statuses:
Not Started
Running
Finished
Gamification:
Points system (no badges or leaderboards at launch)
Data Handling:
All job and schedule data will be manually entered during MVP phase.
Jobs will originate from shipping requests with:
Part number
Operation number
Build quantity
Due date
Forecast Integration:
Will be incorporated after MVP to automate scheduling and trigger job creation.
6.2 Operator Day-One Needs
Ability to view job details:
Part number
Operation
Due date
Build quantity
Ability to claim and update job status
6.3 Department Lead Day-One Needs
Visibility and control of the job queue
Ability to schedule or prioritize jobs manually
Step 7: UX Design & User Flow – Complete
7.1 Mockups/Wireframes
Not yet created
(A wireframe pass can be generated later based on these workflows.)
7.2 Desired User Workflows
Operator Workflow:
Open the app.
Navigate to the Job Board.
Browse available jobs (filtered by department or machine if needed).
Claim or update the job they’re working on (e.g., “Not Started” → “Running”).
Exit the app — fast and minimal friction.
Department Lead Workflow:
Mostly identical to the operator workflow.
May include ability to:
Assign jobs directly to operators.
Reprioritize jobs in the queue.
Shipping Workflow:
Open the app.
Go to Job Request Area.
Enter new job request with part number, quantity, and due date.
Optionally:
Tag job as “Hot”.
Update material status (e.g., “Material Ordered”).
Step 8: Gamification Mechanics – Complete
8.1 Point System Rules
Base Points: Earned for each job completed.
Bonus Points:
More points awarded for:
Difficult jobs
“Hot” (urgent) jobs
Performance-Based Points:
+1 if daily average output exceeds previously recorded average for that part.
+1 if operator sets a new personal best for most parts completed in a single day on a given part.
8.2 Team Bonuses
Weekly Department Goal:
If department collectively earns 5+ points, they get a real-world reward (e.g., brownies or cookies).
Rewards may expand in the future depending on management approval.
8.3 Stats to Track per Operator
Individual job history and completion count.
Personal records for:
Most parts completed in a single day (per part).
Current and best daily averages (per part).
Points history and streak status.
